    <h2>History</h2>
  <p>
  <h3>Founding and Early Years:</h3>
  <p>The school was founded in 2020 by a group of visionary educators who recognized the need for quality education in the community. It started as a small institution with a few classrooms and limited resources. The early focus was on providing basic education to local children.
  </p>
  <h3>
    Expansion and Growth:
  </h3>
  <p>As the school gained recognition for its commitment to excellence, it began to expand both in terms of infrastructure and curriculum. Additional classrooms, laboratories, and facilities were added to accommodate a growing student population. The curriculum evolved to include a wider range of subjects, extracurricular activities, and specialized programs.
  </p>
  <h3>Technological Advancements:</h3>
  <p>With the advent of technology, the school embraced the use of computers and gradually integrated them into the learning process. Computer labs were established, and the school website was launched to facilitate communication and provide access to online resources. Over time, the school adopted digital learning tools and incorporated technology into various aspects of education.
  </p>
  <h3>Community Engagement and Partnerships:</h3>
  <p>Recognizing the importance of community engagement, the school actively collaborated with local organizations, businesses, and universities to enhance the learning experience. Partnerships were formed to provide internship opportunities, mentorship programs, and access to specialized resources. The school also organized community events and outreach programs to foster a sense of social responsibility among its students.
